# Data Mining Course Assignments

My group's implementation of data mining assignments covering general topic in machine learning.
1. fashion_mnist.ipynb: introduction to grid search for machine learning model optimization with the fashion MNIST dataset
2. bayesian_optimization.ipynb: using gaussian processes for neural network parameter optimization.
3. dropout.ipynb: simple experiment of the dropout layer effect

**preamble.py** belongs to the course instructor (https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/). 

To run the notebook, each respective data has to be included in the same folder.
